                <h1>The Scream</h1>
                <p>The Scream is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in <br> 1893. The Norwegian name of the piece is Skrik (Scream), and the <br> German title under which it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der Natur (The <br> Scream of Nature). The agonized face in the painting has become one of <br> the most iconic images in art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human <br> condition. Munch's work, including The Scream, had a formative influence on <br> the Expressionist movement</p>
